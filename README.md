# Unclosed Paragraph Tag Bug in HTML
This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).

Unclosed tags can cause unexpected behavior in the rendering of web pages.  Browsers typically attempt to automatically close these tags but this can lead to inconsistencies in layout and styling, especially in more complex HTML.

**The bug:** The `bug.html` file contains an unclosed `<p>` tag.  This will affect how the text renders.

**The solution:** The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected HTML with properly closed tags.

This example is intended to help developers understand the importance of careful HTML coding and how unclosed tags can cause subtle but significant issues.
